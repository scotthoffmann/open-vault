# Another small corner of the internet.

By day, I leverage data to uncover audience dynamics and develop social strategies that unite communities, spark organic engagement, and create meaningful connections that transcend the screen. I specialize in translating user feedback into meaningful improvements and creating responsive support systems that make people feel heard and respected.

When I'm not knee-deep in the comment section, I've got my [camera in hand](https://instagram.com/p/C9EWczMMTVn)—if you're putting together an event, I'd love to be a fly on the wall. Drop a note and let me know what you're working on.

**I'm based in New York, NY. Get in touch: contact@scotthoffmann.com.**
